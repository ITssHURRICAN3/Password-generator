# Password-generator
Hi, HURRICAN3 here. This is a little project i made recently and it shows how you can create a variable lenght password using python.

First of all we import random to generate random positions for our password and pyperclip to instanly copy to out clipboard the password generated.

Then we create an enormous amount of variables and the main array called password.

The user is asked for the lenght of the password (default is 128)

You will get your password shown and alredy copied to your clipboard ready to get pasted.

Enjoy some protection and stop using 5 letter password ❤️
